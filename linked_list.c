/*
## Linked lists
1. Declare a node structure for a singly-linked list, holding a single `int` value.
2. Declare the list's `head` and `tail` pointers.
3. Initialize the linked list. What does an *empty* list look like?
4. Reason out the different assignment cases for the `list_insert` function. The nodes have to be inserted *in ascending order*. How should the pointer member of the node structure be initialized by default?
5. Implement the `list_insert` function, for all cases you came up with.
6. Test the function for all the cases. Run in the debugger to see if it works. Correct it.
